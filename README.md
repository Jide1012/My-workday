# My-workday

I did this project because as an employee with a busy schedule. I wanted to add important events to my daily planner so I can manage my time effectively. The planner allows me to save events for each hour of the day and is run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.   

Installation: I first set up my HTML with Div classes for the different hours of each time blocks. I also added the save button class to get the save button on the right side of each time block. 

Step 2: After setting up the HTML and CSS the first thing I did in script.js is set the letTodayDate set up Today's Date so it appears at the top of the screeen. 

Step 3: The following step was setting up the variables in miliatary calling the different hours that we set up in HTML and adding it to your local storage. 

Step 4: I then linked the SaveBtn to the saveText and IdentityID. So after I add my text to each time block it will be saved to local storage.

Step 5: The Final thing I did is create is create my timetracker function which had my if/else statement. The statements just tells the reader based on your current time if the time block would be in greyed out, red, or green. If the time had already passed the time block would be grey, If it is the current time the time block would be red and if the time has not happened yet it would be green.
